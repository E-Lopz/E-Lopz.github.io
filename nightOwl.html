            <p>
                <br>As both project manager and lead developer, I'm leading the development of a nightclub simulation and management game under NightOwl Studios.  
                This game allows players to design, manage, and grow their own nightclub, making key decisions on staff, music, venue expansion, and customer satisfaction.  
                The project is in **early development**, and we're focusing on building the core mechanics using **Unreal Engine**.

            <p>
                Players will be able to customize their nightclub, manage events, hire staff, and optimize the club's reputation.  
                The game will feature a dynamic economy, where decisions on pricing, promotions, and guest experiences impact the club's success.

            <p>
                The game is being built with **Unreal Engine**, leveraging its advanced rendering and simulation capabilities.  
                Our goal is to create an immersive experience with **realistic lighting, soundscapes, and crowd dynamics**.
